        <p>Welcome to the support page for Lexi Learn. 
            Below you will find information and resources to help you troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How do the cards work?</li>
            <li>Do word request failures still use my cards?</li>
            <li>Why are my word requests not working?</li>
            <li>How do I reset my password?</li>
            <li>How do I contact customer support?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How do the cards work?</h2>
        <p>When you buy cards, they work to support a response from Lexi.
            Lexi is a busy AI and most of the money goes to supporting the costs of keeping the AI alive.
            The costs are subject to change over time depending on the econonmy and usage.
            When you create a request in the word "search" box and lexi responds with a card - this consumes one card.
            When you click "refresh" on a word card, this will consume one card.
        </p>

        <h2>Do word request failures still use my cards?</h2>
        <p>
            No.
            But if you think they did, please contact support!
        </p>
        
        <h2>Why are my word requests not working?</h2>
        <p>Sometimes Lexi (the AI) cannot find the specific answeres for the specific words you're requesting.
            It will usually tell you why it cannot find the answer in an alert dialog.
            Sometimes repeating the query once or twice can make it "think harder" but ultimately it sometimes still results in failure.
            If you're having an issue that you don't believe should be happing, please contact support.
        </p>

        <h2>Reset Your Password</h2>
        <p>To reset your app, when the app opens up, 
            click the button on the bottom of the login "Forgot password?" 
            and it will walk you through the steps.

            If you're still having issues, please contact support.
        </p>
